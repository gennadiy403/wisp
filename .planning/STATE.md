# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-17)

**Core value:** Frictionless voice-to-text on macOS -- press a key, speak, text appears where you need it.

## Current Position

Phase: 2 (architecture-reliability) — NOT STARTED (next up)
Plan: 0 of TBD
Status: Awaiting `/gsd-plan-phase 2`
Last activity: 2026-05-13 -- Spike 001 validated; roadmap extended with Phase 4 (parallel encoding)
Branch: latency-optimization

Progress: [█████░░░░░] 50%  (2/4 phases done, counting 1 and 1.1)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Rename Wisp -> Govori (exit whisper-brand cluster)
- Single-file architecture reaching ceiling at ~1900 lines -- split in Phase 2
- loguru over stdlib logging (simpler migration from print())
- PyPI-first distribution, Homebrew deferred to v2

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- CGEventTap is the #1 ship-blocker: revoked Accessibility permission can freeze all system input
- Open question: listenOnly vs defaultTap mode for CGEventTap (affects fn key detection)
- Open question: macOS version floor (recommend >=13 Ventura)
